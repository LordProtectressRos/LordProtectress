Salutations.

I am a lady that goes by many names. Rose, Lord Protectress, Clypeus.
Whether or not you use these names is not much concern to me.

I come from Sussex, however my family is Maltese. 
I'm an adult with an interest for the unknown, the esoteric, and all of which is denied to the common populace.
Being open to talk with anyone is a key feature of mine, and any requests for help will likely be answered in some shape or form.

I enjoy reading, and designing flags, with my enjoyment of coding coming mostly from the end result.
I have a GCSE in History, Sociology, Music, and Sports Leadership, and commonly help people build computers or troubleshoot issues.

Pleasure to make your acquaintance.
